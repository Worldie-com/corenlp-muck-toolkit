{"name":"Mechanical Understanding of Contextual Knowledge","tagline":"","body":"What is MUCK?\r\n=============\r\n\r\nMUCK is software for making sense out of massive, messy collections of documents.  This toolkit can be used to take directories of unwieldy amounts of texts, extract useful information (both metadata and linguistic features like parts-of-speech, named entities, and parsed dependencies), and construct a searchable document database with all extracted information readily available.\r\n\r\n## History\r\n\r\nMUCK was initially written to handle large collections of news content and government data, such as news archives, Congressional press releases/floor speeches, and legislation.  The toolkit was designed to answer many different questions that required natural language understanding of these texts.  \r\n\r\n## Tech\r\n\r\nAt the most basic level, MUCK is a standalone web service around the [Stanford NLP group]'s [JavaNLP] library.  It can run on your own machine as a Tomcat servlet that provides a simple RESTful API to the NLP library.\r\n\r\nMUCK was also designed for use on [AWS] platforms, and can scale up by distributing across EC2 instances.  This means that you can add and remove nodes depending on the scale of a text collection.\r\n\r\nMUCK is also intended to complement [Amazon Mechanical Turk], primarily for creating training data needed in classification tasks (topics, sentiment, etc).\r\n\r\n##License\r\n\r\n[MIT].  This is free and open-source.  \r\n\r\n##Authors\r\n\r\nMUCK was created by [Rebecca Weiss], with contributions from Nick Nugent, [Richard Socher], and [Sean Westwood].\r\n\r\n## Acknowledgements\r\n\r\nThe creation of MUCK was made possible with the generous support of the [Brown Institute for Media Innovation].\r\n\r\n## Citation\r\n\r\nIf you use MUCK, please cite the following [paper]:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@InProceedings{weiss:2014:W14-31,\r\n  author    = {Weiss, Rebecca},\r\n  title     = {MUCK: A toolkit for extracting and visualizing semantic dimensions of large text collections},\r\n  booktitle = {Proceedings of the Workshop on Interactive Language Learning, Visualization, and Interfaces},\r\n  month     = {June},\r\n  year      = {2014},\r\n  address   = {Baltimore, Maryland, USA},\r\n  publisher = {Association for Computational Linguistics},\r\n  pages     = {53--58}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n[Rebecca Weiss]: http://www.stanford.edu/~rjweiss\r\n[Sean Westwood]: http://www.stanford.edu/~seanjw\r\n[Richard Socher]: http://www.socher.org\r\n[Stanford NLP group]: http://www-nlp.stanford.edu/\r\n[JavaNLP]: http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/corenlp.shtml\r\n[Classifier]: http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/classifier.html\r\n[MIT]: http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT\r\n[AWS]: http://aws.amazon.com\r\n[Amazon Mechanical Turk]: http://www.mturk.com\r\n[Brown Institute for Media Innovation]: http://brown.stanford.edu\r\n[paper]: https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.rebeccaweiss.info/docs/MUCK_ACL2014.pdf","google":"UA-39179035-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
