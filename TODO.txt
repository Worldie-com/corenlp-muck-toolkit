
Next:
  finish creating new amazon linux ami, updating readme
  get TaskQueue size from a property when you run TaskServer

  fix news.properties pathing from scripts
  add mechanism for feeding new tasks into the server manually/interactively
  handle duplicate inserts...?  check fs against mongo for directory traversal before scheduling jobs?
  write a script to copy and install project files to server

  sampling:
    give each article an integer id, these should be consecutive
    sampling should select a uniform distribution from 1 to N.
    doesn't really need to export the whole entity, probably just pubdate, mediasource, filename, headline, and text
    List<Article> sample(int sampleSize);

Remember:
  Whenever the project files are updated, you need a new AMI.
