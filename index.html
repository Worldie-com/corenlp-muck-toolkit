The MUCK toolkit
================

MUCK (Mechanical Understanding of Contextual Knowledge) is cloud-driven software for making sense out of large text
corpora.  This toolkit can be used to take directories of unwieldy
amounts of text data, extract useful information (both metadata and
linguistic features like parts-of-speech, named entities, and
parsed dependencies) from all documents, and construct a comprehensible
database with all extracted information readibly available.  You can also
use this toolkit to build classifiers from random subsets of this database (as well as
classify the rest of your data in the database) relatively easily...just
not quite yet.

History
-------
MUCK was initially written to handle large collections of news content
and government data, such as newspaper archives, Congressional press
releases and floor speeches, and legislation.  

Authors
-------
MUCK was written by Nick Nugent, Rebecca Weiss, and Sean Westwood.

Version
-------
Currently not even in alpha with no immediate plans for release.  Use at your own
risk!

Tech
---- 
MUCK uses a lot of open-source libraries:
* [Apache Software Foundation] - [Lucene] for text indexing
* [Stanford NLP group] - [JavaNLP] and [Classifier] for natural language processing
and machine learning capability.
* [10Gen] - documents are stored in [MongoDB]

MUCK was designed to integrate onto an [Amazon Web Service] platform,
and can scale up by distribute across EC2 instances.

MUCK is also intended to complement Amazon Mechanical Turk for creating
training data for classification tasks (topics, sentiment, etc.).

Installation
------------
You can  ```git clone git@github.com:rjweiss/MUCK-toolkit.git``.  But
you probably won't want to, since you will need to download and maintain your own
dependencies and build from source on your own system. If you run into
problems, you are unfortunately on your own.  We break this
toolkit on a regular basis with our own projects, so there's no
guarantee that we will be able to solve problems encountered on other
people's systems.
